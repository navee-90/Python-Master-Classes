# class 14
# import tkinter
# tkinter is Python’s standard library for creating Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications.
# It's built on top of Tcl/Tk, and it's used to create windows, buttons, labels, textboxes, and more — all the basic components of a desktop app.

# Comes pre-installed with Python (no need to install separately)

# Great for building small tools, dashboards, and student projects
# Easy to learn and quick to set up
# Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
